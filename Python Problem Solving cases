# Hamlet case

hamlet = "To be, or not to be, that is the question:\nWhether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles\nAnd by opposing end them. To die-to sleep,\nNo more; and by a sleep to say we end\nThe heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks\nThat flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation\nDevoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;\nTo sleep, perchance to dream-ay, there's the rub:\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\nMust give us pause-there's the respect\nThat makes calamity of so long life..."
